## Registers

Till now we know that Flip Flops are a part of sequential circuits and can be used to store a single bit of binary data (1 or 0). 
However, in order to store multiple bits of data, we need multiple flip flops. N flip flops are to be connected in an order to store n bits of data.
A **Register** is a device which is used to store such information. It is a group of flip flops connected in series used to store multiple bits of data.
