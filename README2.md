## Registers

Till now we know that Flip Flops are a part of sequential circuits and can be used to store a single bit of binary data (1 or 0).
However, in order to store multiple bits of data, we need multiple flip flops. 

A **Register** is a device which is used to store such information. It is a **group of flip flops** connected in series and used to store multiple bits of data. The N-bit register consists of N number of Flip Flops and thus stores a N-bit number.
