## Combinational Circuits
Combinational Circuit consists of input variables(i/p), logic gates and output variables(o/p). They are a type of time independent circuits whose output depends upon the present combination of input variables. In other terms, each output is a pure function of input variables. The logic basically performs Boolean Algebra on inputs, where each output is expressed in terms of a combination of (say) n input variables or a Boolean function. The major steps for designing a combinational circuit include making a truth table defining the relationship followed by simplifying the expression using K-Map and hence making a logic diagram using Gates.The circuit does not use any memory or storage.
Some common examples include:
## Adder
 - **Half-Adder**
Half adder is a combinational arithmetic circuit designed to add two single bit numbers and produce a sum bit (S) and carry bit (C) as the output. Thus, 0 + 0 = 0 (S) and 0 (C), 0 + 1 = 1 (S) and 0 (C), 1 + 0 = 1 (S) and 0 (C), 1 + 1 = 0 (S) and 1 (C).
